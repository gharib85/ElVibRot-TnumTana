    <h2>The Testing Framework</h2>
    <p>Tests can be written completely free form. Any single test is an
    executable.  This may be a compiled Fortran program, a shell/perl script,
    or anything else you like that the computer knows how to run. All these
    small test programs can be organized in any way you like inside (or in
    subdirectories of) the &#8216;tests&#8217; folder.</p>

    <p>While you can organize the tests any way you like, I recommend the
    following system for the testing of single routines: Say you have a test
    for the &#8216;init_pulse_time&#8217; routine in pulse.f90. You should make
    a folder &#8216;pulsetests&#8217; that contains all tests of the pulse.f90
    module, and inside there you should create a program
    &#8216;init_pulse_time_test&#8217; (or,
    &#8216;init_pulse_time_test.sh&#8217;, &#8216;init_pulse_time_test.pl,
    etc.). For bigger tests that go beyond testing a single routine,
    you&#8217;re free to put them in their own folder, of course.</p>

    <p>There is one requirement on the test programs: If they pass
    successfully, they must print the string &#8216;PASSED TEST&#8217; (exactly
    like that, with upper case) to the standard output. This indicates success.
    An absence of the string in the output indicates failure.</p>

    <p>Once you&#8217;ve written your test program, and organized it somewhere
    in the tests folder, you have to add the name of the executable (with the
    relative path) to the &#8216;test.lst&#8217; file. This file defines which
    tests to run.</p>

    <p>Any tests listed in test.lst are run automatically when you do
    &#8216;make test&#8217;.</p>

    <p>Note that if you write test code in Fortran which needs to be compiled,
    the main Makefile will automatically locate the new test Makefile and use
    it automatically when &#8216;make test&#8217; is called. For help writing
    your Makefile, see below.</p>

    <p>Lastly you should be aware that the working directory of any test
    executable is the directory where that executable resides.</p>

    <p>In summary, here are the steps for writing a test:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>write the test in any way you like, making sure that is prints
          &#8216;PASSED TEST&#8217; on success</li>
      <li>organize the test inside the &#8216;tests&#8217; folder</li>

      <li>add the path and name of the executable to the tests.lst file</li>
      <li>compilation as well as any temporary files that may have been created
          from running the tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to write Makefiles for tests</h3>

    <p>As previously stated, the tests are completely freeform, meaning that
    you can write the makefile for your test however you like, with one
    exceptions &ndash; the &#8216;clean&#8217; target <em>must</em> be defined,
    since the main Makefile will look for this when you call &#8216;make
    clean&#8217; (or <tt>make test-clean</tt>).</p>

    <p>While not required, since the test Makefile is called from the main
    Makefile, we can make use of the exported variables FC, FFLAGS, and
    LDFLAGS. This means that we don&#8216;t have to redefine these in every new
    Makefile. Here is an example of a Makefile for a new test called
    &#8216;mytest&#8216;:

    <pre>
    # Makefile for mytest, in folder tests/mytest/
    all: mytest
    mytest: mytest.f90
          $(FC) $(FFLAGS) mytest.f90 $(LDFLAGS)
    # make sure that the clean target exists
    clean:
          rm mytest *.mod a.out
    </pre>

    <p>Note that we haven&#8216;t had to redefine the variables: they were
    already passed on by the main Makefile.</p>

    <p>Almost all Makefiles actually look almost identical to each other, and
    so to make writing the Makefiles even easier, there is a makefile
    &#8216;tests.mk&#8217; which can (and should) be included to handle the
    common part of all test Makefiles.  It contains the rules for building your
    test programs, and also a standard cleaning routine. To use tests.mk, we
    only need to include it in our Makefile.  When you use tests.mk, it will
    look for a special variable named TESTS, where one can simply write the
    names of all the source files that need to be compiled. For example, lets
    say in a test folder we have two programs, &#8216;mytest1&#8217; and
    &#8216;mytest2&#8217; that should be compiled from two source files
    &#8216;mytest1.f90&#8217;  and &#8216;mystest2.f90&#8216;. Our Makefile in
    that case is a simple as

    <pre>
    TESTS = mytest1 mytest2
    QDYNPATH = ../../
    include ../tests.mk
    clean: clean-auto
    </pre></p>

    <p>We still need the &#8216;clean&#8217; target, but now we can simply
    point it to a target called &#8216;clean-auto&#8216;, which removes all
    *.o, *.mod, *.dat and *.out files, as well as the test programs themselves.
    You can always add your own custom clean functions underneath.</p>

    <p>The QDYNPATH should point to the root folder of the library. It is necessary
    for compiling a test &#8216;standalone&#8217; (see below)</p>

    <p>It is strongly recommended that you use this simple form for any tests.</p>

    <p>For plenty of examples, check the &#8216;tests&#8217; folder.</p>


    <h3>How to compile a standalone test</h3>

    <p>Often, during development, you want to compile just one specific test.
    If you are in the root folder (where the main Makefile resides), you can do
    <tt>make tests/name/of/test/folder</tt> (no trailing slash!). If the
    main Makefile controls the compilation, all variables are exported
    properly, and everything will work.</p>

    <p>Having to compile from the main Makefile is very inconvenient.  You
    really want to be able to just do &#8216;make&#8217; and 
    <tt>make clean<tt> inside of the test folder.  However, the necessary
    environment variables are exported only if the compilation is controlled by
    the main Makefile.  To remedy this, the tests.mk contains re-definitions of
    the variables which are executed if the environment variable QDYNMAKEST is
    set to 1: <pre>export QDYNMAKEST=1</pre></p> <p> Once this is done, you
    should be able to do <tt>make</tt> and <tt>make clean</tt> directly in the
    test folder. If you forget to set QDYNMAKEST, compilation will fail.</p>
