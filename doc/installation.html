    <h2>Compilation and Generation of the documentation</h2>

    <p>You can compile and generate the documentation of the Tnum-Tana program by using <tt>make </tt> while in
    the top folder which contains the makefile.
    <p>For compilation you have the following possibilities:
    <table border=1>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>make clean install </tt></td>
        <td> Clean up Compile and Install the documentation. 
          The documentation will be installed in the
          <tt>./doc</tt> folder. The excutable files (*.o and .mod) are
          generated in the <tt>./point_o</tt> folder. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>make clean</tt></td>
        <td>Clean up files files generated from compilation:
          all the files  of  <tt>./point_o</tt> and the files *.html of 
          <tt>./doc/reference </tt> .</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>For development, you can also use the following make targets:
    <table border=1>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>make</tt> or <tt>make all</tt></td>
        <td>Compile everything (but don't generate the documentation)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>make clean</tt></td>
        <td>Clean up files from compilation</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>make doc</tt></td>
        <td>Generate the documentation in <tt>./doc/</tt></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> <tt>make work</tt></td>
        <td>Compile the main program whose name (whitout the .f90) is affected to the flag <tt> WORKMAIN </tt> 
          of the makefile.  This will generate the executable file work.exe </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td> <tt>make Tnum_MCTDH</tt></td>
        <td>Compile the main program whose name  is affected to the flag <tt> TNUMMCTDHMAIN </tt> 
          of the makefile. This will generate the executable file Tnum90_MCTDH.exe </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td> <tt>make Tnum</tt></td>
        <td>to be written</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> <tt>make GWP</tt></td>
        <td>to be written</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>The F90 compiler is used to compile *.f90 files. The F77 compiler is
       used to compile *.f files.</p>

    <p>There are also additional details on the make process in the comments of
    the  makefile.</p>
