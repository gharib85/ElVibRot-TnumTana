    <h2>Automatic Doc Generation</h2>
    <p>Documentation is generated automatically from the source code of the
    modules.</p>
    <p>All routines must have a documentation block directly before
    the routine declaration, like in the following example:</p>
    <pre>
  !! @description: Read two columns from an ascii file.
  !! @param: col1      Array for the first column
  !! @param: col2      Array for the second column
  !! @param: filename  File name
  subroutine read_ascii_2col (col1, col2, filename)
    
    real (idp),        intent(inout) :: col1(:), col2(:)
    character (len=*), intent(in)    :: filename
    ...</pre>
    <p>Note that each line in the documentation block starts with a
    double exclamation mark. Private routines should have a documentation block
    just like public routines. The docgen script can distinguish between
    private and public symbols; only public symbols will show up in the
    documentation. The parameter definitions inside the routine are evaluated
    by the docgen script. Always declare intent!</p>

    <p>If a module uses overloaded routines, there must be a documentation block
    right before the interface, giving a description. In addition, the actual
    implementations also need to have a documentation block, explaining the
    parameters. The description given for the implementations is not used, but
    it is still good style to supply it.</p>
    <pre>
  !! @description: Read data from a csv file. The columns in the file are
  !!               separated by spaces. The data is read into arrays of reals,
  !!               one array per column. There can be up to three columns. If
  !!               there are less columns in the file than you try to read,
  !!               the remaining columns are filled with zeros.
  interface read_ascii
    module procedure read_ascii_1col, read_ascii_2col, read_ascii_3col
  end interface

  ...

  !! @description: Read two columns from an ascii file.
  !!               If there are not enough columns in the file, fill the
  !!               remaining ones with zero.
  !! @param: col      Unallocated array for the column
  !! @param: filename File name
  subroutine read_ascii_1col (col, filename)

    real (idp), allocatable, intent(inout) :: col(:)
    character (len=*),       intent(in)    :: filename
    ...
    </pre>

    <p>Type definitions also need a documentation block, very similar to routines:</p>
    <pre>
  !! @description: Information about spatial grid in the config file
  !! @param: dim      number of spacial dimensions
  !! @param: r_min    minimum r, through dimensions
  !! @param: r_max    maximum r, through dimensions
  !! @param: map      mapping, through dimensions
  !! @param: maptype  type of mapping (diff, int)
  !! @param: nr       numer of points, per dimension
  type grid_pt
    integer :: dim
    real (idp), allocatable :: r_min(:), r_max(:)
    logical, allocatable :: map(:)
    character (len=5) :: maptype
    integer, allocatable :: nr(:)
  end type
    </pre>
